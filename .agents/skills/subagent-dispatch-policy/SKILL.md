# Purpose

Choose the next role for one bounded task slice, or stop.

This skill decides only whether the Observer should dispatch and which allowed
role name should receive the handoff.

# Trigger / When to use

Use this skill when:

- one bounded task slice is in `INTAKE` or `ROUTING`
- the Observer needs to choose the next role
- the available evidence is already narrowed to one task slice

Do not use this skill when:

- the work is to build the context package itself
- the work is to route after a returned subAgent verdict
- the task requires workflow-to-agent binding, registry lookup, or runtime
  dispatch semantics

# Inputs

- one bounded task slice
- bounded evidence for that task slice
- current Observer state
- allowed target roles:
  - `Planner`
  - `Implementer`
  - `Reviewer`
  - `Plan-Creator`
  - `Plan-Reviewer`
  - `Tester`
  - `Explorer`

# Process

1. Confirm the task is a single bounded slice.
2. Confirm the Observer is not being asked to self-perform Planner,
   Implementer, Reviewer, Plan-Creator, Plan-Reviewer, Tester or Explorer work.
3. Check whether real dispatch can be established:
   - separated role instruction surface
   - separated task context package
   - explicit handoff payload
   - explicit result payload contract
   - no hidden role simulation
4. If any real-dispatch condition is missing, stop.
5. If the task requires registry behavior, workflow binding, runtime semantics,
   or concrete role-agent files, stop.
6. Choose exactly one next role name or return `stop`.
7. Emit the decision without file paths, registry keys, catalog identifiers, or
   launcher-specific names.

# Examples

- **Positive**: A frozen implementation task slice needs concrete edits within
  an allowed write set, real dispatch is available, and the skill returns
  `Implementer`.
- **Negative**: The request asks for "whoever owns `.github/agents/...`" or
  depends on runtime launcher wiring, and the skill returns `stop` instead of a
  path-based target.

# Outputs

- `next_role`: `Planner` | `Plan-Creator` | `Plan-Reviewer` | `Implementer` | `Reviewer` | `Tester` | `Explorer` |
  `stop`
- `reason`: short factual reason
- `stop_condition`: `none` or exact blocker

# Validation

## Required Checks

- `PASS`: the input is one bounded task slice, the Observer is in `INTAKE` or
  `ROUTING`, real dispatch conditions are established, and the result is
  exactly one allowed `next_role` or `stop`.
- `BLOCKED`: stop when the available evidence cannot distinguish between more
  than one allowed next role, when real dispatch cannot be established, or when
  proceeding would require workflow binding, registry behavior, runtime
  semantics, or concrete role-agent files.

## Quality Checks (best effort)

- `SOFT FAIL`: mark status as `INCOMPLETE` when the bounded slice is clear
  enough to return `stop`, but the factual reason or blocker evidence is thin,
  incomplete, or not crisply cited.
- Under `SOFT FAIL`, still return the best bounded decision, list the missing
  evidence explicitly, and avoid expanding the routing scope.

# Failure Handling

## Missing Context

- If required dispatch evidence is missing but `stop` is still clearly the only
  safe output, return incomplete output with `next_role: stop` and name the
  missing inputs in `stop_condition`.
- If missing context could reasonably change which allowed role should receive
  the handoff, mark the result `BLOCKED` and stop instead of guessing.

## Ambiguous Requirement

- If the request blurs dispatch selection with context-building, verdict
  routing, workflow reconstruction, or runtime binding, stop and state that the
  request is outside this skill's boundary.
- Do not guess between allowed roles when more than one reasonable
  interpretation remains.

## Execution Limitation

- If the environment exposes only path-based targets, registry hints, or
  launcher-specific names, return `stop` or `BLOCKED` with the limitation stated
  explicitly.
- Do not fabricate hidden role support, concrete agent ownership, or runtime
  dispatch capability.

# Boundaries

- Do not build the context package.
- Do not route based on a returned subAgent verdict.
- Do not encode full existing workflows.
- Do not output concrete file paths as targets.
- Do not infer agent registry, catalog, or runtime capabilities.

# Local references

- `examples.md`: positive and negative dispatch-selection scenarios, including
  hard-stop cases

## Local role selection

Planner checks sufficiency/readiness; Plan-Creator drafts/revises plans;
Plan-Reviewer independently reviews planning contracts; Implementer writes
bounded code/fixes; Tester runs bounded verification; Reviewer independently
reviews implementation/evidence; Explorer does read-only exploration.
Code-Implementer and Code-Reviewer are aliases, not additional roles.
All roles obey current mode and write authorization. In Plan Mode every role
is read-only and Plan-Creator drafts only in conversation.
